## Synopsis

This is a Python library to help interface with Seaport. It includes various helper methods and constants that makes interfacing with Seaport easier. These include creating orders, fulfilling orders, doing the necessary balance and approval checks, and more. We recommend taking a look at the [Seaport](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport) docs to get a better understanding of how the Seaport marketplace works.

## How to use

As of now, this is mostly a template library to help users understand how to use Seaport. Look at the various methods in `seaport.py` to understand how to create orders, fulfill them, and more. The test files also serve as a good example of a variety of different use cases Seaport can handle.

We will look into publishing this as a Python package when needs arise.
